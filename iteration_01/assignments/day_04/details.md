# Class Workshop & Lab Work – Today’s Plan

## Purpose of Today’s Class
Given the challenges many students faced during the last class with GitHub accounts and Git clients,
today will be focused on **a workshop-style session**. The goal is to provide dedicated time to get 
caught up, clarify questions, and ensure everyone is ready to move forward.

## What You Should Work On

### 1. Past Activities
- If you have **unfinished activities** from:
  - `day_01`
  - `day_02`
  - `day_03`  
  this is the **ideal time to complete them**.  

- Be **proactive**:
  - Ask questions whenever you are unsure.
  - Check in with your neighbors — help each other out if someone is stuck.

### 2. Current Lab
- The **current lab** is also assigned.
- If you have already completed your previous activities, focus on **working on the lab**.
- Collaborate with classmates who are also working on the lab for extra support and teamwork practice.

## Expectations for Productivity
- Use this time wisely: the quicker we complete the Python onboarding activities, the sooner we can
move on to **larger, team-based projects**.
- If you **don’t have questions**, actively help classmates who do.
- You are encouraged to work in the classroom **or elsewhere in Gilder** if you need a different space to focus.

## Key Takeaways
- Today is about **catching up, collaboration, and asking questions**.
- Completing these activities efficiently will allow us to move to more engaging, hands-on Python projects soon.
